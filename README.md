# Python-Currency-Converter
A simple yet powerful currency converter built with Python. This project includes two versions: a straightforward command-line application and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Tkinter. It uses real-time exchange rates fetched from the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
